\title{Speed Accuracy Switching Data}

\description{

	This data set is a bivariate series of response times and accuracy
	scores of a single participant switching between slow/accurate
	responding and fast guessing on a lexical decision task.  The slow and
	accurate responding, and the fast guessing can be modelled using two
	states, with a switching regime between them.  The dataset further
	contains a third variable called Pacc, representing the relative
	pay-off for accurate responding, which is on a scale of zero to one.
	The value of Pacc was varied during the experiment to induce the
	switching.  This data set is a from participant A in experiment 
	1a from Dutilh et al (2011).
