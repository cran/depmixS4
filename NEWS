Changes in depmixS4 version 0.3-0
  
  o added multinomial response function with identity link (no covariates
    allowed in such a model); useful when (many) boundary values occur; 
    currently no constraints are used for such models, and hence only EM
    can be used for optimization, or alternatively, if and when Rdonlp2
    is used, sum constraints need to be added when fitting the model.
    See ?GLMresponse for details. 

  o added an example of how to specify a model with multivariate normal
    responses (and fixed a bug in MVNresponse that prevented such models
    from being specified in the first place). See ?makeDepmix for an 
    example. 

Changes in depmixS4 version 0.2-2

  o fixed a warning produced when specifying conrows.upper and .lower in
    the fit function

  o added error message in case the initial log likelihood is infeasible

  o fixed a bug in the fit function for multinomial response models with 
    covariates (thanks to Gilles Dutilh for spotting this)

Changes in depmixS4 version 0.2-1

  o fixed a bug in the Viterbi algorithm used to compute posterior states
    (this bug was introduced in version 0.2-0)
  
  o restructured test files somewhat

  o fixed a bug in the use of the conrows argument in the fit function (a 
    missing drop=FALSE statement)

  o updated help files for mix classes

  o fixed a bug in setting the starting values of regression coefficients in 
    prior and transInit models with covariates (thanks to Verena Schmittmann 
    for reporting this)

  o added newx argument to predict function of transInit objects, to be used
    for predicting probabilities depending on covariates (useful in eg plotting
    transition probabilities as function of a covariate)

  o added example of the use of conrows argument in fitting functions and other 
    minor updates in documentation
  
Changes in depmixS4 version 0.2-0

  o restructured R and Rd (help) files; added depmixS4 help with a short
    overview of the package and links to appropriate help files
  
  o added function 'simulate' to generate new data from a (fitted) model
  
  o added function 'forwardbackward' to access the forward and backward 
    variables as well as the smoothed transition and state variables
  
  o added new glm distributions: gamma, poisson
  
  o added multivariate normal distribution
  
  o freepars now works correctly on both depmix and depmix.fitted objects
  
  o added function 'nlin' to compute the number of linear constraints in 
    a fitted model object

  o added mix class for mixture and latent class models; the depmix class 
    extends this mix class and adds a transition model to it
  
  o added help file for makeDepmix to provide full control in specifying 
    models
  
  o minor changes to make depmixS4 compatible with R 2.7.1
  

Changes in depmixS4 version 0.1-1

  o adjusted for R 2.7.0

First version released on CRAN: 0.1-0
